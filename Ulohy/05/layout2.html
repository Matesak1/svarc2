            <p>Owl Cult needs YOU.</p>
            <p>People from all over the globe are protesting againts the Owl Cult. To protect us, we need to collect more souls to grow more powerful. Problem is, we are kinda running out of volunteers for our soul collecting proccess and therefore we are in need of more. We ask everyone if they would be so kind and kill their closest relatives and bring their bodies to our cults designated destination. Said destination is kept secret and only the true Owl Cult members will be able to figure it out. We wish you farewell and may the GREAT OWL look over you.</p>
