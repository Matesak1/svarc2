<h4>O mně</h4>
<section class="about">
<p>Hi! You may call me Mathew instead of that so complicated name on top you see. Yes that Mathew is typed using only one "t". Anyway i am a 17 years old human teen that currently studies IT and programming as of typing this. I always wear scarfs, dot ask why, its just who i am. I like cooking and playing video games with my interest for the future being game development. I dont do sports but i used to do many, like basketball, volleyball, roler blading, ping-pong and athletics. I also attended some hobby groups like social interactions and game friday. Moving on, i live in Hřebeč. Its a small village not far from Kladno. I wont give you the specific adress. Thats about all you NEED to know about me in this section.</p>
<h4>List of my skills</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>Gaming</b> = Obviously i am an absolute god in games (not really). Anyway i easily understand rules of games and get really good in just a few rounds. For example in INFINITODE 2, i am within the top 2% of all players in the world this games season. Also i play many games, i dont have some particual interests in genres.</li>
    <li><b>Cooking</b> = Like previously mentioned, i like cooking. I sometimes cook dinner so that my mom doesnt have to complain about everything. I make my own breakfast, but i suppose almost everybody does that. I know how to cook some basic dishes like spaghetti, fried food or entire pizzas done from scratch.</li>
    <li><b>Moderating</b> = I am an admin/moderator on quite a few discord servers. Now the discord servers are quite small so i suppose it doesnt count as much. But i do help and do my job correctly.</li>
</ul>
