<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p> Hi, my names Mathew, and yes it is typed with just one "t" on purpose. Deal with it.</p>
<p> I am a 17 year-old human teen, that hasn't lived through much yet. I quite frankly despise humanity as a whole and i think planet Earth would be a lot better place if humans never existed in the first place. I don't believe in God because if god was real, he wouldn't let humanity destroy his own collection of creations. I tend to be quiet, introverted and arrogant, but i try to be friendly and help others. Also i am a profesional gamer with 183 followers on twitch. Yes i flex with nothing in particular. I always wear scarfs, currently i have 7 of them but my mom is making an 8th one.
<h2>How i inspire myself</h2>

<h2>In all seriousness</h2>
<p>I live inside my head. I have thousands of universe created in my head and yet even more are added frequently. I dont know what keeps me going. I used to self injure myself. Suicidal thoughts, went to therapy, etc... I really have no clue. I guess im just inspiring myself via imagination that i know will never be real.</p>
