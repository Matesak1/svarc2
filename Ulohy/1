    <h1>Re: Planes plan message</h1>

    <p>Hi Plane!</p>

    <p>
      Its been quite a long time since we last talked. I would ask how you were doing but i can leave that to the party you have planned and need help with. If you dont feel like sending a message, you can catch me live on my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Mathew_Plane">twitch</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>When it could take place</h2>

    <p>
      I have reached out to Cyan and Onyx regarding when they can join us. I trust you will contact Tasque and Viper. Anyway regarding all the possible times when it can take place, i got these for this year:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First possible day: <time datetime="2025-10-18">18. 10. 2025</time>
      </li>
      <li>
        Second possible day: <time datetime="2025-10-14">14. 10. 2025</time>
      </li>
      <li>
        Third possible day: <time datetime="2025-09-11">9. 11. 2025</time>
      </li>
      <li>
        Fourth possible day: <time datetime="2025-12-10">10. 12. 2025</time>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    If these days work for you and Tasque and Viper, reply. Worst case scenarion, it will be next year.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What will be there</h2>
    
    <p>
    Obviously the most important thing is what things will be there to do at the party. Considering that there will be atleast 6 of us there. We need atleast 1 table for 4, but maybe the UGs would also want to go to. I also have a few more ideas to add:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
    	<li>
    	 Karaoke Machine. <abbr title="Matesak2">M2</abbr> made one because he was bored so maybe we could "borrow" it. Been a while since we last sung (even tho i hated it), and Cyan seemed to enjoy it a lot.
    	</li>
        <li>
        An entire flight course. Jet sized for you Plane obivously, but also for others to test. Onyx agreed he will let us use his flight boards, so technicly all of us can go and speed through some loops in the air. Not like anyone can beat a jet anyway, so more like for fun rather than competitive.
        </li>
        <li>
        My DJ set. Just like last time, we can experience Viper completly ruining music. We all had fun with it last time so why not again? Could also be used alongside the Karaoke Machine.
        </li>
    </ol>
    
   <p>
   Respon to what you think about these. And to let you know, i agree with all your ideas you gave for the party.
   </p>
   
   <h2>Where shall it take place</h2>
   <p>
   Lastly is that we need a place to throw it at. I was thinking at our base but thats where the last 3 parties happened so we need some new place fresh. Sure there wont be your fancy hangar, but i know you like fresh stuff too. We could try the <abbr title="Matesak">M</abbr> verse. And i do mean that. <abbr title="Matesak1">M1</abbr> agreed so we can (also increases the odds of them joining). They made a new sector that has a flat grassy landscape with a lake full of H<sub>2</sub>O... Sorry meant to say water. What do you think? You will have plenty of space to land and fly. Far away from any housing so we can be loud as we want. And under a night sky! Perfect place by me.
